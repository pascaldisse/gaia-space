# Integrations

This document covers the various third-party integrations available in Gaia Space and how to use them.

## Discord Integration

The Discord integration allows you to connect Discord servers to your Gaia Space workspaces, syncing channels for better collaboration.

### Setup Process

1. **Accessing the Integration**
   - Navigate to any workspace
   - Select the "Integrations" tab
   - Click on the Discord integration card

2. **Connection Flow**
   - **Step 1: Connect Account** - Authenticate with your Discord account
   - **Step 2: Select Server** - Choose which Discord server to connect
   - **Step 3: Select Channels** - Pick specific channels to sync with your workspace

3. **Managing Integrations**
   - View all connected Discord servers
   - Sync channels to get latest updates
   - Edit integration settings
   - Remove integrations when no longer needed

### Technical Implementation

The Discord integration uses Discord's OAuth2 flow and REST API to:
- Authenticate users
- Fetch available servers (guilds)
- Access channel information
- Sync messages and updates

### Permissions Required

Discord integration requires the following permissions:
- `identify` - To identify the user
- `guilds` - To access the list of servers
- `channels` - To access channel information
- `messages.read` - To read messages for syncing

## Planned Integrations

### GitHub/GitLab Integration

Connect your code repositories directly to workspaces:
- Track commits and pull requests
- Link issues to workspace tasks
- Trigger builds from the workspace

### Slack Integration

Two-way communication between Slack and Gaia Space:
- Sync channels and messages
- Receive notifications in Slack
- Send updates from workspace to Slack

### Jira/Trello Integration

Connect task management tools:
- Sync tasks and issues
- Update status from either platform
- Link work items across systems

### Cloud Storage Integration

Connect cloud storage services:
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- OneDrive

## Integration Development

### Creating New Integrations

To develop a new integration, implement the following components:

1. **Models**:
   - Create integration model class in `lib/core/models/`
   - Include methods for serialization/deserialization

2. **Service**:
   - Create service class in `lib/core/services/`
   - Implement authentication and API methods

3. **State Management**:
   - Create providers in `lib/core/providers/`
   - Set up state management for the integration

4. **UI**:
   - Create integration screen in `lib/ui/screens/`
   - Implement connection flow UI

### Integration Testing

Each integration should include:
- Unit tests for models and services
- Integration tests for API communication
- UI tests for the connection flow
